My solutions for http://adventofcode.com programming puzzles. I try to solve these with just Java where I can. So far one external dependency was needed, as Java doesn't come with a json parser (see puzzle 12/2015).

Year 2017 was the first time I tried to actively use functional elements that came in java 8, sometimes using them even if imperative version was easier.

Most of the time, solutions are just the first thing that came to my mind and might not be optimized and they are badly documented. Occasionally I've done heavy optimization. The git history starts only from 2021, as the original repo contained all kinds of stuff that was not supposed to be there.


# Dependencides

I'm using my own [helper library](https://github.com/vilhok/aoc-lib) to fetch inputs.


### A solution does not work?
Might be an edge case for some inputs, I've fixed one before. The code was completely broken, but worked by luck. 

 Open an issue and I might look into it.
